# Blog Article Writer

This skill helps create high-quality blog articles that provide genuine value, are immediately actionable, and engage readers naturally.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Genuine Value Over Recycled Advice

Don't regurgitate common advice. Dig deep for fresh insights that could genuinely shift how someone approaches their work.

**Ask before publishing:** Would I bookmark this if someone else wrote it? If no, keep working.

### 2. Make It Immediately Actionable

An insight without a blueprint is entertainment, not education. Walk through the actual process step by step—give them a system they can implement today.

### 3. Natural Engagement

Structure content to create natural engagement:
- Use hooks with "here's how" or "why X doesn't work"
- Make the first paragraph clear and valuable
- Take a controversial stance OR keep it open and collaborative
- Pick the approach that fits the content

### 4. Easy to Read

Most people scan quickly. Make it visually digestible:
- Short, punchy hook
- One sentence per line or short paragraphs
- Use lists for complex information
- Add white space between sections
- Avoid walls of text

### 5. Simple, Conversational Language

Write like a smart person who chose simple words to be understood, not to sound impressive.

- Use "use" not "utilize"
- Say "help" not "facilitate"
- Write "get better" not "optimize performance"

**Test:** If your 14-year-old cousin couldn't understand it, it's too complex.

### 6. Recognizable Style

Develop 3-4 structural elements you use frequently:
- Blockquotes (">") to break down processes
- Specific opening patterns
- Conversational markers for controversial takes
- Strategic use of fragments for emphasis

Be consistent without being formulaic.

## Article Structure

### Opening
- Start with a hook that signals immediate value
- Use personal narrative, bold statement, or clear question
- Make the problem and solution crystal clear

### Body
- Break into clear sections with descriptive headers
- Use ">" blockquotes for key principles or steps
- Include examples, case studies, or personal experiences
- Use lists to organize complex information
- Add white space liberally

### Closing
- Summarize key takeaways
- End with actionable next steps
- Make it feel complete, not abrupt

## Technical Implementation

For Hugo-based blogs:

**Frontmatter format:**
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
title: "Article Title"
description: "Brief description for SEO"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
categories: ["category"]
---
```

**Image usage:**
```
{{< figure src="/images/..." title="..." align=center >}}
```

**Formatting:**
- Use markdown headers (##, ###)
- Use lists (-, *, 1.)
- Use blockquotes (>) for emphasis
- Include code blocks when relevant
- Write in first person for personal experiences
- Explain acronyms and technical concepts
