I've had a lot of conversations with guys at different stages of life, and there's this pattern I keep noticing.

Talk to younger guys and you'll see this fire in their eyes. They want to do something, prove something. A lot of them saw their parents work jobs they never wanted them to work. They want to change that situation ASAP. And there's this urgency too-their parents are aging, and what's the point of success if it comes too late for them to enjoy it?

Then there are guys in their early 20s, already stressed about earning "decent wealth" because let's be honest, society judges men heavily on this. Wedding expenses, buying a home these are apparently the two major high-ticket items an average guy has to worry about. The pressure starts early.

And my seniors? A lot of them have their partners or kids as their phone wallpapers. You can just tell how deeply they care about their family. Their whole world revolves around them. The expectation is usually that men handle the financial responsibility, especially when kids come into the picture.

I genuinely don't know if this provider mentality is something innate or just societal pressure. Maybe it's both. Maybe it doesn't even matter at this point.

What I do know is that most men are out here carrying a lot dreams, responsibilities, expectations and often doing it quietly. Not always expressing what's going on inside. Just grinding through it.

So yeah, Happy Men's Day to all of you. To the ones racing against time for their parents, to the 20-somethings figuring out life under pressure, to the guys building everything for their families. You're doing more than you give yourself credit for. 💙
