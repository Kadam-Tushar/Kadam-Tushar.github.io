title: 'On Self-Introductions'
description: "A good self-introduction is not who you are, it’s who you are for them"

"Self introductions should not be about yourself." There I said it! Sounds counter intutive right? 

> A good self-introduction is not who you are,
> it’s who you are for *them*.

That line reframed everything for me. I'd spent years treating intros as a chance to *express* who I am—when the real job is to show who I am *for the person in front of me*. The goal isn't self-expression. **It's alignment.**

So what's actually going on when you're talking? The other person isn't just listening. They're running a quiet question in the back of their head:

> “Where do I place this person in my mental map?”

Leave that question unanswered and you get misclassified, forgotten, or underestimated. 
Most of us (me included) lead with *what we do* and *who we are*. The lever that actually moves the needle: **why should they care—in this context?**


Okay, enough theory. Here are situations that show up all the time when you're in your twenties in India—and how to tailor your intro so they actually place you right.

**1. Placements, job interview, or recruiter at a campus drive**  
*Why they care:* Can you do the job? Will you fit our company?  
Lead with the role you're targeting and one or two proof points that match (project, internship, tier of college if it helps). Skip the long story. Example: "I'm [name], from [college/branch]. I'm looking for [role]—I've done [X project/internship] in that space, so I'm really keen on [this company/role]."

**2. First day as a fresher / meeting the team**  
*Why they care:* How do we work together? What will you own?  
Anchor in your role and how you'll show up for *them*. Example: "I'm [name], joining as [role]. I'll be working on [X], so you'll see me in [stand-ups / this pod / reviews]. Happy to help with [Y] if you need."

**3. Alumni meet, startup event, or conference (Blr, Mumbai, etc.)**  
*Why they care:* Do we have overlap? Is this worth a LinkedIn add or a follow-up?  
Give a one-line hook that makes it easy to continue the conversation. Example: "I'm [name]—I'm from [college/batch] too, now working on [domain]. Currently trying to figure out [specific thing], so I'm here to learn from people who've been there."

**4. Referral request or "can I get five minutes?" call**  
*Why they care:* Why are you reaching out? What do you want from me?  
State your ask and why *they* in one sentence. Example: "I'm [name], I got your number from [mutual]. I'm applying for [role/company] and your experience at [X] is exactly what I wanted to understand—so thanks for taking the time."

**5. Indian wedding, family function, or "whose beta/beti are you?"**  
*Why they care:* Which family? What do you do? How do I include you in the conversation?  
Give them something to latch onto so they can place you and loop you in. Example: "I'm [name], [friend/cousin]'s friend—I'm from [city]. I work in [field] / I'm preparing for [UPC/CA/etc.]—so if the conversation goes there I can chip in; otherwise I'm good just listening."

**6. First meeting with a client or stakeholder (Indian business context)**  
*Why they care:* Are you the right person to talk to? Will you get things done?  
Lead with what you own and how it connects to *their* problem. Example: "I'm [name], I'm the point of contact for [area] on this engagement. So for anything around [X] or [Y]—I'm the one who'll take it to closure."

In every case, the move is the same: **before you open your mouth, ask yourself why they should care in *this* context.** Then answer that—and cut the rest.
