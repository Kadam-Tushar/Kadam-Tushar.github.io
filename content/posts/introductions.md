title: 'On Self-Introductions'
description: "A good self-introduction is not who you are, it's who you are for them"

"Self-introductions shouldn't be about yourself." There, I said it. Sounds counterintuitive, right?

Here's the line that reframed everything for me:

> A good self-introduction is not who you are,
> it's who you are for *them*.

I used to treat intros as a chance to *express* who I am. Turns out the real job is to show who I am *for the person in front of me*. Think about it—when you're introducing yourself, the story that actually matters is the one forming in *their* head. They're quietly asking: "How does this person fit in my world?"

My go-to used to be: "Hi, I'm Tushar, I'm a software engineer." Polite nods, sure. The only time someone really bit was when they were in tech too and asked where I worked. In personal settings? Crickets. (No offence to crickets. They're great at filling silence.)

Things changed when I started framing my intro around what I could do *for* them. Small shift—completely different response.

**Interviews.** They're really answering one question: can we hire this person? So tune your intro to that. Lead with what helps them decide—relevant projects, experience in the same space—and trim the rest. If your college doesn't add signal for them, drop it; if it does (e.g. lots of alumni there), keep it.

**Parties and social stuff.** Nobody showed up to hear "I'm a software engineer." They're there to chill. So I listen first. What are people talking about? Sports, F1, content creation, philosophy? I have a few hooks ready. Marketing person? I mention the Twitter page I'm trying to grow. F1 enthusiast? I don't keep my eternal dislike for McLaren to myself. Tech or ML? That's my job—I get paid for that one, so I can own it. Philosophy? Stoicism, Meditations, Marcus—and what I'm reading. Same me, different shade depending on who's in front of me. You're not pretending; you're just choosing which part of you gets the mic.

**When you know nothing about them.** Honestly, it's rare. You can almost always infer something—you're on a trip, they're into travel too; you're at a café, they like coffee. Start with a minimal intro and flip the question back. "I'm [name], just passing through—what brings you here?" Then listen. You'll find a common thread. If you don't, you still learned something.



Someone might say: aren't we forgetting to show who we *are*? I don't think so. We've got a lot of shades. We're not hiding—we're just picking the one that sparks a real connection. Same person, different room, different slice.

I read this somewhere and it stuck: *"Seek first to understand, then to be understood."* Your intro works best when it starts from their world, not yours.
