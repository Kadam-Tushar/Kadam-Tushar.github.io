Why Were Women Banned from Olympic Shooting?

In 1992, Zhang Shan, a Chinese shooter, made history—winning Olympic gold in skeet shooting against men. But instead of celebrating this, the International Shooting Union took a bizarre step: in 1996, they banned women from competing in the event. No explanation. No separate category. Just exclusion.

### A Sport of Precision, Not Strength

Shooting isn’t about brute force—it’s about focus, control, and nerves of steel. That’s why men and women used to compete together. But after Zhang Shan’s victory, the rules changed. By 2000, they reintroduced a separate women’s event, but studies still show no real performance gap between genders. So why were women ever banned?

### Does Biology Give an Edge?

Some argue that women might even have advantages in shooting. Their hip structure offers better stability in the standing position, while men’s taller build and upper body strength are better suited for sprinting, not holding a rifle steady. So, was this ban about performance—or just outdated thinking?

### Women Already Outperform in Some Sports

While men dominate in speed and power, women often outlast them in endurance sports like long-distance swimming. Their higher body fat percentage improves buoyancy and insulation, giving them an edge over longer distances. Science says women can compete, but tradition says otherwise.

### The Future of Mixed-Gender Events?

Equestrian events have always been gender-neutral, and the 2024 Paris Olympics will see full gender parity in participation. Should more sports embrace mixed competition, or do separate categories ensure fairness? The debate isn’t over.

At the end of the day, skill wins medals—not gender.
