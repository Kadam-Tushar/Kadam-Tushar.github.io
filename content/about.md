## Hello, I'm Tushar ðŸ‘‹

I work on ML systems at **[EarnIn](https://www.earnin.com/)** (a fintech startup) where I work on building ML systems that (hopefully) donâ€™t break in production. Before this, I was a **Data Scientist** at **[Mastercard](https://www.mastercard.co.in/en-in.html)**, diving deep into data-driven decision-making. I did my masterâ€™s from I[ndian Institute of Science (IISc)](https://iisc.ac.in/), Bangalore, where I spent a lot of time in ML research and managing my sleep schedule.

In this space, I share my thoughts on ML systems, deployment headaches, and all things Fintech. Expect a mix of insights, experiments, and occasional rants about why models behave the way they do (or donâ€™t).

Also documenting about random topics that pique my curiosityâ€”because why not?
